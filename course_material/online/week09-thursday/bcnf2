Produce BCNF schema for real-estate example
R(P#, When, Address, Notes, S#, naMe, Carreg)

P -> A
A -> P
S -> MC
PW -> SC

R = PWANSMC
fds = {P->A, A->P, S->MC, PW->SC}
key = PWN    (PWN+ = PWANSMC)


problem: P->A
fix: PWNSMC and PA

PA has only 2 attrs => BCNF

PA
fds = { P->A, A->P }
key = P or A


PWNSMC
fds = { S->MC, PW->SC }
key = PWN

problem: S->MC
fix: SMC SWNP


SMC
fds = { S -> MC }
key = S

is in BCNF


PA* SMC* SWNP


SWNP 
fds = { PW->S }
key = PWN

PWS
fds = { PW->S }
key = PW
=> in BCNF


PWN
fds = { }
key = PWN
=> in BCNF


Final BCNF schema: PA SMC PWS PWN

PA = property table
SMC = staff table
PWS = visits table
PWN = notes for visit
