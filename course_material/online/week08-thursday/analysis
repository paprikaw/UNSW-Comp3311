The difference between one query and multiple queries

avgs
q = query calculating avg mark for all relevant course
foreach result in q
   print course info + average mark

avgs2
q = query getting all relevant courses
foreach course in q
   q1 = calculate avg for course
   get average mark
   print course info + average mark


$ time ./avgs > /dev/null

real	0m5.253s
user	0m0.127s
sys	0m0.021s

$ time ./avgs2 > /dev/null

real	5m22.421s
user	0m1.605s
sys	0m0.303s


The lesson:
- DO NOT nest queries in the programming language
- as much as possible, do everything in a single query
