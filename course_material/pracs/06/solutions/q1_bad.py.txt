"""
Produce a list of names, and for each name, what their mostly highly rated movie title they've acted in is. If they haven't acted in a film, exclude them from the list.

Note: This is an example of a sub optimal solution due to the fact that we're unnecesarrily
      running a query without a loop, which could be solved by a sub-query. Database calls
      require I/O which adds a performance overhead to applications and, while necessary, should
      be reduced as much as possible
