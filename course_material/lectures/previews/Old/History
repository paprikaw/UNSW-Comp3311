                              "Why Database ?"

     * Recognition  that data are an important corporate asset and that a
       DBMS is an appropriate tool for effective use and protection
     * Requirement for flexibility and adaptability
     * Need to share data resources within the organization

     * File  Processing  Vs.  Database  Processing  Vs.  ERP  (Enterprise
       Resource Planning) Processing
     * In File Processing Systems:
          + Data  is  partitioned  into  separate  files  with  different
            formats
          + Each application has its own separate program
     * In Database Processing Systems:
          + Data is integrated into a central database with common format
          + Each application has its own separate program
     * In ERP Processing Systems:
          + Data is integrated into a central database with common format
          + All  applications  are integrated into one (huge) coordinated
            system

     * Levels of Data:

Bit

Byte = Character

Field

Record

File

Database

     * A database is a self-describing collection of integrated files.

   A  DBMS  is  a complex computer program that acts as a data librarian,
   supervising  the  transfer  of  data  between  the  end  user  and the
   database.
