<exercise> Book Publishing
Develop an ER design for the following scenario:
<small>
<itemize>
<sitem> for each person, we need to record their tax file number (TFN),
        their real name, and their address
<sitem> authors write books, and may publish books using a <q>pen-name</q>
        (a name, different to their real name, which they use as author of books)
<sitem> editors ensure that books are written in a manner that is
        suitable for publication
<sitem> every editor works for just one publisher
<sitem> editors and authors have quite different skills; someone who is
        an editor cannot be an author, and vice versa
<sitem> a book may have several authors, just one author, or no authors
        (published anonymously)
<sitem> every book has one editor assigned to it, who liaises with the
        author(s) in getting the book ready for publication
<sitem> each book has a title, and an edition number (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
<sitem> each published book is assigned a unique 13-digit number (its ISBN);
        different editions of the same book will have different ISBNs
<sitem> publishers are companies that publish (market/distribute) books
<sitem> each publisher is required to have a unique
        Australian business number (ABN)
<sitem> a publisher also has a name and address that need to be recorded
<sitem> a particular edition of a book is published by exactly one publisher
